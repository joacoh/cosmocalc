# Ned Wright's Cosmology Calculator in Python3
In this repo I'll try to improve the previous version of this code written by James Schombert in Python 2.7

The idea is to a main function that do exactly the same as the JavaScript version available in the web and multiple specific functions that can be easily imported to other projects for further use.

Right now this repo contains just the old version by James Schombert, but I'll work in this as a side-project.
