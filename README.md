# Ned Wright's Cosmology Calculator in Python3
In this repo I'll try to improve the previous version of this code written by James Schombert in Python 2.7

The idea is to create a main function that do exactly the same as the JavaScript version available in the web and multiple specific functions that can be easily imported to other projects for further use.

# Pre-requisites:
- Python3 (3.10.6 or above)
- Astropy (5.1 or above)

To install Astropy, you first need to have installed PIP

In Linux:
    apt install python3-pip
In MacOS:
    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
    python3 get-pip.py
    
Then, with PIP installed, install Astropy:
    pip install astropy
    
And now you are ready to run the new_version,py script!

Please don't use old_version.py, it is the deprecated version.
